/**
 * Core.ST.W5 starter — blink the status LED.
 *
 * The W5 is the radio one: STM32WBA55, Cortex-M33 with Bluetooth LE. What
 * differs from the L4/H5 templates:
 *
 *   - No USB. The WBA55 has no USB peripheral, so there is no CDC, no
 *     1200-baud touch, and no `make flash-dfu`. Flash over SWD with
 *     `make flash` (STM32CubeProgrammer + an ST-Link; OpenOCD has no WBA55
 *     support), or from Studio / probe-rs over the CoreProbe.
 *   - The watchdog is on (5 s), same as every other Core — the IWDG is plain
 *     hardware here and works fine. What the W5 does NOT get is the
 *     strike-counter escape into ROM DFU, which needs USB. Recovery on this
 *     Core is SWD, which a probe can always reach.
 *
 * For BLE, build with BLE_ENABLED=1 and see the ble-* projects under tests/.
 *
 * "clock": "medium" is 32 MHz from the HSE. Raise it to "high" (64 MHz) or
 * "max" (100 MHz) in config.json when you need the headroom.
